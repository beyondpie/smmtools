# smmtools

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of __smmtools__ is to analyze 10x multi-omic ATAC sequencing data with SnapATAC pipelines.
This package is mainly based on ArchR, SnapATAC and SnapTools. The significant difference is that we decentralize the data representation, and make smmtools as a pool of different functional utilities. So that users can combine different functions and complete the tasks. Also it's quite easy to hack smmtools by either adding new functions or change some functions.
