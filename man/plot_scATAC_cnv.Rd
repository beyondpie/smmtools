}
\arguments{
\item{raw_mat}{A binned coverage matrix (m1 bin by n1 cell) with values being read counts for scATAC-seq of tumor sample (with some normal cells). The matrix can be generated using https://github.com/seasoncloud/Basic_CNV_SNV/blob/main/scripts/Gen_bin_cell_atac.R}

\item{cell_type}{A matrix with two columns: COL1- cell barcodes; COL2- cell types (Tumor cells should be labeled with "tumor1, tumor2 and etc.").}

\item{normal_lab}{Character(s) indicating the cell types considered as normal cells. If not specify, "normal" cell type should exist in the cell_type dataframe.}

\item{size}{A matrix with two columns: col1: different chromosome; col2: for the size (bp) of different chromosomes (eq.1-22).}

\item{window_w}{window size for signal pooling in individual cells.}

\item{window_step}{step size for signal smoothing in individual cells.}

\item{plot_path}{Path to plot the heatmap.}

\item{nclust}{Integer. Number of clusters the rows are divided into for visualization and clustering.}

\item{var.filter}{Logical (TRUE/FALSE) Whether or not to filter our highly variable features.}
}
\value{
A vector indicating the ordered cluster number (from hierarchical clustering) of each cell and a heatmap saved.
